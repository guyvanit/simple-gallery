# simple-gallery (WIP)
Simple (command-line) tool to view and navigate through images in a directory using C++ and SDL

## PLAN:
 - Run executable in command line
 
     NOTE: lets try to focus on running in current direct. first
 - Fetch all image files in current directory
 - Display the images with navigation:
      - Display individual image -> arrow keys to navigate
      - Display all images in a square matrix of images (?)
      
 EXTRA: implement as command line tool to run anywhere?
